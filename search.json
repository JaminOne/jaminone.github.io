You would then be able to delete the files in your local clone, commit that change to your local repository, and then push that change to the remote repository on GitHub.\n\nThe steps for doing this are:\n\nIn the command-line, navigate to your local repository.\nEnsure you are in the default branch:\ngit checkout master\nThe rm -r command will recursively remove your folder:\ngit rm -r folder-name\nCommit the change:\ngit commit -m \"Remove duplicated directory\"\nPush the change to your remote repository:\ngit push origin master\nI hope this helps!","tags":["test"]}]
